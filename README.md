# MVC_HOMEWORK2

## This is Homework Two.

This is for the class N315 and I am going to upload this. Setup similar to the MVC_START assignment we did two weeks ago. Tried to get unique data for all links but it breaks and overrides, stumped on how to fix it. Also not sure how to add a picture unless I use a creatElementById() function but unsure as to where it would go within the Model section.
